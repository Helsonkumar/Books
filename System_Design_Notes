System Design Notes:
==================================

Proxy Vs Reverse Proxy
---------------------------
Proxy : 
1. Anonymity (clients are hidden from the service provider
2. Caching
3. Geo Seperation
4. Blocks unwanted content

Reverse Proxy :
-----------------
1. Load Balancing
2. Caching
3. Canary Deployment ==> Where a new change is deployed in one server and few of the client traffice is servered by this updated server.

Load Balancing:
-------------------
This is a special case of reverse proxy. 
Here the proxy server stores and manages the metadata of the backend server.
Eitheir distributes the load in ROUND_ROBIN fashion or based on the hearbeat or health check result of the backend server.
