Data Qualities 4 Dimensions  :
==================================
Accuracy
Comprehensive
Timely
Consistent

If a data element does meets these std then it is not good for business decision making
You might probably loose bsuiness due to inaccurate data elements...eg inaccurate appointmnt details by the appt booking system

We must report DQException to CDO or CDG (governance officers)
The major reason fro DQE  : Human error whislt making data entry , process error , etc
So we are building a DQP as Global Function to enable data from various system to send us feeds and have them validated and reported via DQE reporting process.

Goal is to Make Sure Data Is Fit For Purpose.




Data Silos : 
==============
A data silo is a collection of data held by one group that is not easily or fully accessible by other groups. 
... Finance, administration, HR, and other departments need different information to do their work, and those individual collections of often overlapping-but-inconsistent data are in separate silos.
Silos restricts internal transparency and productivity
They cerate friction adn Duplication of efforts
Its a cultural change to brek silos

Information Silos occur when Data Mgmt system is incompatible or unable to integrate with other system.
Due to lack or comm between business.
Eliminating data silos leads to effective and informed decision making
Eliminates operational redundancies


***Data silos undermine productivity, hinder insights, and obstruct collaboration. 
 Centralizing in the cloud has advantages in that cloud technology has been optimized to make centralization practical.
 simplifies data integration ETL, data governance, security, and regulatory compliance while providing silo-busting access to data by every department.
 
 E:g  : Snowflake  : Talend Data Fabric

A data silo is a collection of data held by one group that is not easily or fully accessible by other groups.

Data silos limit the view of data
How can you find hidden opportunities for operational cost savings, for example, if operations and cost data arenâ€™t consolidated? 

Data silos threaten data integrity
For example, if data on the same patient is stored in different systems, this data can become out of sync over time. 

Data silos waste resources

Data silos discourage collaborative work


How to break down data silos
What took weeks, months, or years can now be accomplished in days or hours with tools that streamline the process of gathering data into a common pool and format for efficient analysis


Change the culture

Develop a way to centralize data : The best way to bust silos is to pool data into a cloud-based data warehouse or data lake 
Data from disparate sources are homogenized and consolidated, and access can be easily granted to individuals or groups.

Integrate data

Scripting : Changes in data sources require scripts to be updated, so maintenance becomes a cost and time burden for IT professionals.

On-premises ETL tools : ETL (extract, transform, and load) and ELT tools automate the process of moving data from various sources to the data warehouse. 

Cloud-based ETL : ETL breaks down silos by providing the technological means to gather data from different sources into a central location for analysis. 
                  ETL helps handle data integrity issues so that everyone is always working with fresh data.
