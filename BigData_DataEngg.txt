Presto : Dist Query engine to query data at light speed (analytical queries) like  DW at the scale of dist systems
Used to retrive data from HDFS at faster speed.
Also from Hive , Cassandra, MongoDb , RDBMS
A single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources, allowing for analytics across your entire organization.
Presto is targeted at analysts who expect response times ranging from sub-second to minutes.
It reads directly from HDFS, so unlike Redshift, there isn't a lot of ETL before you can use it.

Presto was designed to handle data warehousing and analytics: data analysis, aggregating large amounts of data and producing reports.
These workloads are often classified as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).

In query tool selection decisions, we should consider its performance in both big data and moderate data environment, in both batch mode and interactive mode.
